## Development Setup

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

   ```
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

The development server includes live reloading, so any changes you make to the files will automatically refresh the browser.
